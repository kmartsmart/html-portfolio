<h2>Top 5 Movies</H2>

    <h3>Rear Window (1954) By Alfred Hitchcock</h3>
    <p>Lovers of suspense and mysteries will be enraptured by this film. I personally love the aesthetic of Hitchcock's films, but the acting and plots often find you just as involved in the story as the characters. The mundanity of the settings and the circumstances that unravel create a highstake and tense climax bound to leave you on the edge of your seat. </p>
    <h3>The Strangers (2008) By Liv Tyler & Scott Speedman</h3>
    <p>The terrifying reality of home invasion is brought to life in this film, inspired by true events. The main characters are a couple that are given very minimal exposition, but are dealing with a tumultous relationship following a sour proposal. The arrival of a suspicious stranger at their door in the middle of a secluded area in the wee hours of the night make for an unsettling situation. The couple are left to face against the intruders that are anonymous, evasive and eccentric as they allude, harrass and terrify them at every corner. Don't blink! This movie has many subtle moments and titular jumpscares. If you want to be immersed in true suspense, watch this at home alone at night with all the lights off. And don't answer that door.</p>
    <h3>Talk to Me (2023) By Danny and Michael Philippou</h3>
    <p>I did not know what to expect with this film. It had a very interesting premise where supernatural meets party game meets Gen Z. I felt the characters were very believable and the elements of horror are subtle but well-suited to the plot. I think if you are into the supernatural and a story that leaves you wondering and longing for more. Talk to Me will surely be that film. Will you them it in?</p>
    <h3>Urban Legend (1998) By Jamie Blanks</h3>
    <p>You ever hear about scenarios that just seems so stupid to be real. Well Urban Legend takes all that puts into one movie and throws in an incredible cast. I personally found the opening kill scary because I am paranoided by home invasions or creepy "where is the killer?" silent moments. I was honestly amused and wildly entertained by this movie, it is a perfect pairing in a double feature with Scream, if you are looking for a night of cheesy jumpscares, genuine laugh out loud moments, and perfectly balanced horror satire. Can you guess who's the killer?</p>
    <h3>Psycho (1960) By Alfred Hitchcock</h3>
    <p>Norman Bates is played by the charming and endearing Anthony Perkins. I absolutely love his performance as a sweet, boy next door innkeeper. His peculiar yet warm dialogue and delivery completely set the mood of the film and makes the ending even more compelling as to how disturbed of an individual he is. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is a dame who didn't deserve such an end, but her death has been an iconic one for horror fans everywhere. I have just one question, if you were in her shoes that night, would you spend the night at Bates Motel if greeted with such a warm reception by a debonair Norman?</p>
